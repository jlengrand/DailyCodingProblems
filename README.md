# Daily Coding Problems 

My solutions to [Daily Coding Problems](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/).

Those are not the official solution, just mine :). I don't claim they are the best. I shoot for simplicity and clarity.

I am also not a premium member of their service nor am I affiliated, so I haven't seen their solutions. 
If you want detailed solutions, I suggest you get a premium account! 


Solutions are in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (Try it, it's awesome).

## Solutions

Solutions are usually in a single file, named after the day of the problem. Example Day1018.kt is for Day 1018. I don't use particular libraries to solve the problems but you can clone and use `./gradlew build` if you want to complete suite.
In each file you will find the complete description of the problem in comments. I also added a screenshot of the description in [EMAILS.md](./EMAILS.md).


| Day         | Name     | Difficulty | Company |
---|---|---|---
| [965](./src/main/kotlin/Day965.kt) |UTF-8 encoding     | Easy      | Google
| [1018](./src/main/kotlin/Day1018.kt) |Clock Angles     | Easy      | Microsoft
